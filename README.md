The Lunar Lander Q-Learning project in Reinforcement Learning involves training an agent to land a spacecraft on the moon's surface using the Q-Learning algorithm. The agent learns to maximize rewards by exploring different actions (thrusting, rotating) in various states of the environment (position, velocity). Over time, it optimizes its policy to land successfully without crashing. The task emphasizes balance between exploration and exploitation, state-action value updates, and reward maximization.
